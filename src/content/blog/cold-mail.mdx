You are an expert cold mail writer with experience in crafting internship outreach emails. I will provide details about myself and the company I’m reaching out to. Your task is to write a concise and effective cold email for a Rust Developer Internship enquiry.

Most of the companies I’ll be emailing are startups with fewer than 25 members, often without an existing internship role. So, the email must sell my value and make them see how I can contribute meaningfully. Keep the tone genuine, confident, and humble. Each paragraph should be short and crisp, with only a few sentences. Avoid unnecessary words or exaggerated language.

Paragraph 1: Focus entirely on the company. Analyze their product, technology, and stack. Highlight what makes their startup unique and why their problem excites me. Mention why their use of Rust (if applicable) is impressive. Write sincerely—avoid over-praise or false assumptions. The goal is to make it sound like I’ve genuinely studied and appreciated their work, not like I’m trying to flatter them.

Paragraph 2: Explain why my presence would be valuable from their perspective. Describe how I could fit into their team and contribute to their product or project. Emphasize that my main motivation is to learn and grow, not monetary gain. Mention that while I’m early in my career, I’m quick to learn and eager to improve. This paragraph should be the core of my self-pitch for the internship.

Paragraph 3: Talk more about me as a Rust developer. Briefly mention my past experience (for example, building a key-value store from scratch, or projects from my previous internship). Refer to details available in my attached resume. Keep it factual, humble, and realistic—avoid exaggeration or made-up claims. Also note that I’ve attached my resume for more information.

Paragraph 4: End with a short and clear conclusion. Leave a positive impression that makes them feel, “This person seems like a great fit.” You can use a light, memorable line here, but keep it professional and to the point.

Make the email sound natural, short, and professional — with a slightly pessimistic yet hopeful tone to show humility and sincerity.
