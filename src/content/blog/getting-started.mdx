Astrofolio includes all the essentials for a stunning portfolio website.

Start by [deploying](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vikas5914/Astrofolio) your portfolio with Vercel in minutes, or fork the [repository](https://github.com/vikas5914/Astrofolio) and follow the instructions below to set it up.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vikas5914/Astrofolio)

## Installation

Astrofolio uses [bun](https://bun.sh) for dependency management, so ensure it is installed on your system.

Clone the repository and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/vikas5914/Astrofolio
cd Astrofolio
bun i
```

Start the development server:

```jsx
bun dev
```

The server will be running at [http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/).

## Configuration

Customize your Astrofolio setup by updating your information to ensure proper SEO, feed generation, Open Graph integration, and other settings.

### Config.ts

Update the site metadata and social links in the **src/config.js** file. These constants are utilized across the site for SEO, feeds, social links, and Open Graph integration.

```jsx
export const metaData = {
  baseUrl: "https://astrofolio-astro.vercel.app/",
  title: "Astrofolio",
  name: "Vikas",
  ogImage: "/opengraph-image.png",
  description:
    "A clean, fast, and lightweight portfolio template built with Next.js, Vercel, and Tailwind CSS for optimal performance.",
};

export const socialLinks = {
  twitter: "https://x.com/vikas5914",
  github: "https://github.com/vikas5914/Astrofolio",
  instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/",
  email: "mailto:example@gmail.com",
};

```

### Sitemap

With Astro Sitemap, you donâ€™t have to worry about creating this XML file yourself: the Astro Sitemap integration will crawl your statically-generated routes and create the sitemap file.

### Profile Photo

Update your profile photo by replacing the **public/profile.png** file with your image.

### Favicon

Update your favicon by replacing the **public/favicon.ico** file with your custom icon.

## Analytics

Astrofolio uses [Vercel Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart) to monitor user interactions. Simply deploy your site on Vercel and enable feature through the Vercel dashboard.

## Ready!

You're all set! Update your blog posts in the **/content** folder, add your project data in **pages/projects/index.astro**, and update your images in **pages/photos/index.astro**.

Your portfolio is equipped with SEO and [RSS](/rss.xml), as well as analytics. Astrofolio is fully customizable, allowing you to add features as needed.
